Our 2016 DevFest Hackathon is inspired by our [2015 FireHacks](https://firehack.splashthat.com/) event. Just like last year, we are looking for diverse teams of 2-5 people who have not just a working prototype, but also a valid business model and user acquisition plan that could potentially take them from idea to startup.
<br/><br/>

### **THE PLAN**
But we hope to do things a little differently this year. 
* We are limiting the Hackathon to 50 or so attendees (ideally 12-15 teams)
* We posted a [**Hackathon CFP**](http://bit.ly/devfestnyc-2016-hackcfp) to solicit applicants
* We will invite a selected subset to form teams ahead of time, and assign them a mentor to help formulate ideas _before_ the event
* Mentors will work with teams to ensure that both technology and business choices are made meaningfully, and that team roles are set ahead of start time.
<br/><br/>

By the time you arrive at the event, all you should have left to do -- is *CODE*. It is our hope that the process helps you by providing more structure and guidance early in the process, and helps us by allowing judges and audience to see a richer and more complete product pitch that they can really envision using in their daily lives.

Interested in trying out for a team? [**Sign up now**](http://bit.ly/devfestnyc-2016-hackcfp) and start planning your next steps.
<br/><br/>

### **THE RULES**

* Teams must have 2-5 members (first-time hackers welcome)
* Teams must have a mandatory Firebase component (can be as simple as hosting, or as complex as full-stack+analytics support)
* Teams must have a business model and user acquisition strategy planned ahead
* Teams MAY undertake preliminary focus groups or user research on their ideas
* Teams MUST NOT have started writing any code prior to the event. They may however work with mentors to explore code labs or figure out how-tos for various features, using the technologies of relevance.
* Teams MAY received additional points for using signature technologies including: Android, Polymer, Progressive Web Apps, Cloud ML or Physical Web.
<br/><br/>

### **THE PRIZES**

There will be separate prizes for *audience* and *judge* selected entries. Details of the prizes will be revealed at the event, and will consist of a mixture of hardware and cash based on the category and team size.
