One that allowed you to work with objects and store them as such with a powerful query system. No transformations back and forth to a relational store. Well, you’re in luck, one does exist: Realm. Realm is a mobile object (MVCC) database that can do all of these things and more. In this session learn how you can rid yourself of SQL, SQLite and its binding chains so you can harness the power and speed of working with native objects in Realm.",
